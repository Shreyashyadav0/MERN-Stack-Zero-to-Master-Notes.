Best way to learn a coding is by doing, I have learned a lot of thoeries nothing mattered Practice on Bitdegree.org from scrath, what to do next - practive again and again and again till you get comfortable to solve problems subconsiously. Thats the way my friend there is no other way, All theory is waste of time this is not Arts or medical this is Pure form of engineering which is internally pure form of mind- Maths . Without Practice your wasting your time stop it, go do some other useful stuff and only return if you have guts to do own your own. Sorry if I hurt you but truth needs to be told.
